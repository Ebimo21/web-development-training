    <p>Don't speak tech? It's ok. But, you should still know how a website works so you don't get hoodwinked on your next project.</p>
    <p>Everybody knows what a website is.  We click the little blue letters, we Google the things, type in the www-dot-something-or-other and then you’re looking at cat pictures. That’s how a website works, right?</p>
    <p>Considering it’s something almost all of us use daily, for many of us the internet can still be a bit of a mystery. A few years ago, our public officials were still referring to it as a “series of tubes.” And there’s so much jargon thrown around, it’s hard to know which way is up sometimes.</p>
